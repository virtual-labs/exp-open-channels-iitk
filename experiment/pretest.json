        "d": "Attains negative value"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The correct answer is attains maximum value. In turbulent flow, the friction factor tends to a relatively constant value, especially in rough pipes, due to the chaotic nature of the flow that increases resistance. Unlike in laminar flow where the friction factor decreases with increasing Reynolds number, turbulent flow maintains a high friction factor because the energy losses due to friction are significantly higher.",
